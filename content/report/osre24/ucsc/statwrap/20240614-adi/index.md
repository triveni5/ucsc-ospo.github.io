Namaste🙏🏻! I am {{% mention adi %}}, currently pursuing a degree in Computer Science and Engineering at IIT(BHU). This summer, I will be working on the [StatWrap: Automated Reproducibility Checklists Generation](/project/osre24/northwestern/statwrap/) project under the mentorship of {{% mention lrasmus %}}. You can view my [project proposal](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1xV7eHL9lIWGKueQJxBks6OB_rcXCr8JY/view?usp=sharing) for more details.

My project aims to integrate customizable reproducibility checklists into StatWrap, using metadata and user input to automate their generation. The goal is to enhance the reproducibility of research projects by providing researchers with structured and comprehensive checklists to ensure their work is reproducible.

Stay tuned for updates on my progress in the coming weeks! 🚀
