Welcome to my UCSC OSPO profile!
This mirrors my personal website at the time of writing and may be outdated.
**For the latest info, please visit my [homepage](https://www.jaytau.com?ref=uc-ospo).**

I am a pre-final year undergraduate student at [BITS Pilani](https://www.bits-pilani.ac.in), majoring in Computer Science.
My research interests lie in computer systems, specifically distributed systems, storage systems, high-performance computing, and MLSys.

In my free time, I enjoy running (find me on [Strava](https://www.strava.com/athletes/jaytau)), reading (follow me on [Goodreads](https://goodreads.com/jaytau)), and watching shows at 2x speed (check out my [Trakt](https://trakt.tv/users/jaytau))!
