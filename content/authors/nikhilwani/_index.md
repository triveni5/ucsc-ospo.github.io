I'm Nikhil, a Machine Learning Researcher and Engineer.

My current research interests broadly include human-centered [NLP](https://aclanthology.org/) and [ML](https://aaai.org/). I also absolutely enjoy contributing to the [SIGCHI](https://sigchi.org/) community (area chair, reviewer, student volunteer, publishing papers, etc.) and often like using HCI methods when conducting ML research, lately in the realm of Human-AI interaction and explainable AI (xAI).

I recently graduated from the [University of Southern California (USC)](https://usc.edu/) with Computer Science [honors](https://www.cs.usc.edu/academic-programs/masters/cs_ms_honors/) and a master's thesis. Following that, I worked as a Machine Learning Engineer II at [VMware](https://www.vmware.com/) in their Palo Alto HQ in Stanford Research Park. I've also enjoyed some great summer ML research internships at [NVIDIA](https://nvidia.com/) and [IIT Bombay](https://www.iitb.ac.in/). Throughout my career, I have been fortunate to have had kind and humble research advisors who have shaped my worldview on success and failure, both in research and life, for which I am very grateful.

I like the outdoors. In my spare time, you'd find me hitting sixes on the cricket pitch! :)
